## **Task**
- Write in C language an implementation of an abstract data type - a "polymorphic" collection based on a dynamic array. Write a wrapper to test this implementation. By polymorphic, in this case, we mean an array that can store (and process) values of various types. What exactly is meant by processing depends on the specific version of the task.
